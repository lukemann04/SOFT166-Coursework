# SOFT166-Coursework
This repository is for my memory sequence game that uses the Hue lights in SMB109.

## Aplication Description:
This appliction is a website that consists of 4 separate pages - the Home Page, the Game Page, the About Page and the Lights Page.

On the Home Page there is a brief introduction to the website and instructions on how to use the game.
The Game Page is where you will find the memory squence game. When the 'Show Sequence' button is pressed the background on the page will 
change colour to display a sequence of colours. The aim of the game is to press the coloured buttons in the same order as the sequence shown.
If your answer is correct, the back ground will turn green, your score will increase by one and the next sequence will be one step longer.
On the Game Page there is also a dropdown list where the you can select which light you would like to use for the game. If no light is selected,
then light 1 will be used. If you are playing the game on a computer in SMB109, the Hue lights will change colour along with the background.
The About Page has more information on how the Hue lights in SMB109 work.
The Lights Page contains a series of buttons that allow you to test your connection to the lights and look at the different colours used in the game.

## Testing against the Web Accessibility Initiative (wai):

Guideline 1: Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content.

  There is currently no auditory content on the website. As the website makes use of the Hue lights in SMB109, these provide an           equivalent alternative to visual content.

Guideline 2: Donâ€™t rely on colour alone.

  Due to the nature of the game, this one is difficult. Sound could be added to the website i.e. the colours displayed are                 simultaneously said. Unfortunately, I am currently unable to do this.

Guideline 3: Use markup and style sheets, and do so properly.

	My website makes use of the Bootstrap style sheets.
  
Guideline 4: Clarify natural language usage.

	All language used is laid out clearly and is easy to read and understand.

Guideline 5: Create tables that transform gracefully.

	No tables are used on my website.

Guideline 6: Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully.

	My website will not function properly on older web browsers such as Internet Explorer.

Guideline 7: Ensure user control of time sensitive content changes.

   The background on the game page binks to change colour, however, this does not happen in quick succession and can be stopped by          navigating to another page using the navigation bar at the top.

Guideline 8: Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces.

  The user interface follows the principles of accessible design.

Guideline 9: Design for device independence.

  The game functions properly with a range of input devices. I have tested it with a mouse, trackpad and touch screen. Unfortunately, a   keyboard cannot be used to interact with the game.

Guideline 10: User interim solutions.

  Pop-ups and other windows do not appear until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows. Furthermore, the current window       will not change without informing the user.

Guideline 11: Use W3C technologies and guidelines.

	W3C technologies such as HTML and CSS are used.

Guideline 12: Provide context and orientation information.

  The website is laid out in a way to make navigation and use easy for all users. Further instructions for use are provided where         necessary.

Guideline 13: Provide clear navigation mechanisms.

	The website has clear and consistent navigation mechanisms.

Guideline 14: Ensure that documents are clear and simple.

  The language used is clear and simple. Page layout and graphics are recognisable and easy to understand.
