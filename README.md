# SOFT166-Coursework
This repository is for my memory sequence game that uses the Hue lights in SMB109.

## Aplication Description:
This appliction is a website that consists of 4 separate pages - the Home Page, the Game Page, the Index Page and the Lights Page.
Screenshots of each page can be seen bellow:

On the Home Page there is a brief introduction to the website and instructions on how to use the game.
The Game Page is where you will find the memory squence game. When the 'Show Sequence' button is pressed the background on the page will 
change colour to display a sequence of colours. The aim of the game is to press the coloured buttons in the same order as the sequence shown.
If your answer is correct, the back ground will turn green, your score will increase by one and the next sequence will be one step longer.
On the Game Page there is also a dropdown list where the you can select which light you would like to use for the game. If no light is selected,
then light 1 will be used. If you are playing the game on a computer in SMB109, the Hue lights will change colour along with the background.
The Index Page has more information on how the Hue lights in SMB109 work.
The Lights Page contains a series of buttons that allow you to test your connection to the lights and look at the different colours used in the game.
